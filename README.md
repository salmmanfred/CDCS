# How to use:
In the input file type something like this:  
```
(name_of_province, name_of_state, population_weight)
```
you can add however many you want to  
and in the app you just have to select the file you wrote this in.    
After that enter in the population amount and all other details.  
In the build file section dont forget to add ./ otherwise the file will be written in the root directory.
